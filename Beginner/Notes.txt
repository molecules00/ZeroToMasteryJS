-> Console Command : is an object and inside of this object we have a lot of methods
-> Comments : is one of the commands that compiler ignores when it compiles your codes
-> Sudo Code : is a code which is use implementation purposes or just to show how the codes work but it will not run or work
-> Syntax for declaring a variable (Reserved Keyword such as : var , let and const) (Variable name) (Type of Value)
-> When declaring a variable you should not begin with number like so : let 10fav_fruit = "Dalandan"; but instead we can use numbers after the first letter like so : let fav_fruit10 = "Dalandan"; and Also the underscore (_) and Dollar Sign ($) is the only special characters allowed in the variable name.
-> This special characters can also be the in front of the upcoming letters for the variable name
-> This is different case convention
    > Kebab Case: kebab_case ==> Mostly used in Python
    > Camel Case: camelCase ==> Mostly used in JavaScript Community
-> You cannot change the value of constant variable once to declare it 

Primitive Types Variable: 
1. Numbers

-> typeof : is a reserved keyword in JavaScript that returns what type of variable are we going to show
-> % modulos operation and it gives us the remainder like so, console.log(2 % 2); result = 0 . Using ** in basic math it gives us power of specific number like so , console.log(2 ** 2); result = 4
-> ++ increment , -- decrement
-> NaN : means not a number 
-> falsy value
    > false 
    > null : can be set by the programmer 
    > undefined : can be set by the JS compiler
    > 0
    > -0
    > NaN
    > '',"",`` (back ticks), (empty Quotes)
-> Equality Operators 
    > === Strict Equality
    > !== Strict non-Equality Operators
    > == lose Equality Operators
    > != not Equality Operators

-> `` (back ticks) => we can use this for multi line and appending variable like so : 

Type Conversion 
-> Convert String to Number (Integer) like so : 
    let money = "50";

    money = parseInt(money); 

    // Other way to convert String to Number  
    money = +money; // (Short Method)
    money = Number(money); // (Constructer)
    console.log(money);

-> Convert Number to String like so : 

    let money = 50;

    money = money.toString();

-> Convert String to Decimal like so  :

    let money = "40.2331";

    money = parseFloat(money);
